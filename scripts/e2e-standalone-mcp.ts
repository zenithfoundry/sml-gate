/**
 * @fileoverview
 * End-to-End Test: Standalone MCP (`e2e:standalone-mcp`)
 * 
 * Expected Outcome:
 * The test connects to `mcp-gate` via stdio in standalone mode (with `DOWNSTREAM_MCP` unset)
 * and tests both major prompt conditioning scenarios:
 * 1. Short Prompt (<300 chars): Verifies that small prompts are enriched with auto-resolved
 *    ambiguities and clarification context. Explains why character count increases on short inputs.
 * 2. Large Prompt (>2000 chars): Verifies that verbose prompts containing extensive prose/fluff
 *    are significantly compressed (character count reduced) while preserving mandatory contract
 *    lines (`MUST`, headings, code blocks) verbatim.
 * 
 * Why this test is needed (Why it exists):
 * This test guarantees that `mcp-gate` functions independently as a prompt conditioning tool.
 * It ensures that both enrichment (resolving decisions for concise tasks) and distillation
 * (compressing verbose guidelines) operate correctly and preserve strict contract guarantees.
 * 
 * Warning Expectations / Potential Flakiness:
 * - Requires Ollama running locally with the target SLM model.
 * - If the local SLM times out, a fallback is triggered gracefully.
 * 
 * @returns {Promise<void>} Resolves when all test cases complete, or exits with non-zero on failure.

# Comprehensive Architecture & Enterprise Deployment Standard Operating Procedures

## 1. Executive Summary & Historical Background
In modern distributed cloud software systems, application architecture requires continuous adherence to quality attributes, scalability requirements, maintainability benchmarks, and enterprise reliability guidelines. When developers and agents interact with automated infrastructure workflows, there is often significant background history to consider regarding legacy configuration management, operational runbooks, infrastructure provisioning, and continuous deployment strategies. This historical context illustrates why engineering standards evolved over the past decade through various organizational iterations and architectural transitions across multiple infrastructure providers.

Throughout the early phases of monolithic system evolution, cross-functional teams frequently struggled with coordination bottlenecks, brittle release pipelines, tightly coupled dependencies, and inconsistent deployment procedures. As software systems transitioned toward distributed microservices and decoupled event-driven architectures, organizations adopted diverse tooling ecosystems ranging from custom shell orchestration scripts to complex container orchestration runtimes. These architectural shifts introduced substantial operational complexity, requiring engineers to continuously balance deployment agility with governance, security compliance, performance guarantees, and fault tolerance.

## 2. General Architectural Principles & Theoretical Frameworks
It is generally recommended that engineers maintain clean documentation, organize files systematically, ensure code clarity across all modules, and practice good version control hygiene. While these recommendations serve as helpful advice across varied teams, they are primarily narrative context intended to guide architectural thinking. In many systems, teams spend considerable time debating conventions, file directory structures, naming schemes, database migration schedules, and deployment timeframes. Many architectural discussions delve deeply into theoretical trade-offs that have little direct bearing on immediate execution tasks.

Furthermore, software maintainability is heavily influenced by cognitive load and architectural legibility. When design systems become overly convoluted or burdened with superfluous abstractions, downstream development velocity decreases and troubleshooting latency increases. Engineers are encouraged to adopt modular design paradigms, minimize circular dependencies, prioritize interface contracts over implementation coupling, and establish clear boundary contexts between domain entities.

## 3. Mandatory Implementation Requirements
You MUST adhere strictly to the target environment security constraints.
You MUST never commit plain-text credentials or API secrets to version control.
You MUST write unit tests with at least 80% branch coverage for all core services.

## 4. Operational Procedures and Workflow Execution
When initiating a build sequence, several preparatory checks should be conducted. First, ensure that local package dependencies are synchronized across the developer environment. Second, inspect the workspace tree for uncommitted artifacts or transient cache directories that might pollute build outputs. Third, review the active branch to confirm it is branched from the latest main tracking branch. Fourth, verify that environmental prerequisites, including runtime engines and container runtimes, are actively running in the host environment. Furthermore, ensure that telemetry sinks are available if distributed tracing is activated.

During pipeline execution, intermediate build artifacts must be validated against deterministic checksums to guarantee repeatability across staging and production clusters. Continuous integration runners should enforce static analysis gates, linting checks, type-checking passes, and automated vulnerability scanning before proceeding to container image generation.

\`\`\`typescript
export function initializeService(config: { serviceName: string; port: number }): void {
  console.log("Starting service with configuration:", config.serviceName, config.port);
}
\`\`\`

## 5. Multi-Region Deployment and Disaster Recovery Considerations
High-availability architectures typically employ active-passive or active-active multi-region deployment topologies to mitigate regional infrastructure outages. Data replication topologies, latency routing policies, global load balancer health probes, and automated DNS failover mechanisms must be periodically tested via simulated failure drills. Team members should maintain familiarity with runbooks covering database point-in-time recovery, partition healing procedures, cache invalidation storms, and traffic shedding algorithms.

## 6. Observability, Telemetry & Post-Deployment Checklist
Always review the deployment log output before promoting a release to staging environments. Ensure all stakeholders are notified of maintenance windows. Collect structured metrics regarding request throughput, error rates, p99 latency distributions, and saturation levels across computing nodes.

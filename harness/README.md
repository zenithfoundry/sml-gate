## What this actually measures

The harness answers **ONE** question: "is the router smart — does sending the hard tasks to the big model beat sending random tasks?" It helps you measure the quality of the router's decision-making. 

It does **NOT** measure your real-world savings; that is what the ledger is for.

| Tool | What it measures | Requirements | When it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Harness** | Is the router smart (quality)? | Needs API cloud key | On demand |
| **Ledger** | Did I actually save money/quota? | Works on subscription too | Passively during normal use |

## The 30-second mental model

You have a **small local model (SLM)** that runs for free on your machine, and a **big paid model** in the cloud. 

When the local model isn't confident it can get an answer right, it **escalates** (hands the task) to the big model. Ideally, you want to escalate *only* the hard tasks to save money while keeping your accuracy high.

To see if this is working, we draw a **deferral curve**: we plot our accuracy against "what fraction of tasks we escalated," and compare our real router to a dumb baseline that just escalates random tasks. If the router beats the random baseline, it's genuinely picking the right tasks to escalate.

## The five "arms" explained like a bake-off

We run the same dataset of tasks through five different strategies (arms) to see who wins:

- **all_slm**: Only uses the small model (cheapest, but lowest accuracy).
- **armA**: Only uses the big model (most expensive, highest accuracy).
- **random_at_f**: A dumb baseline that escalates a random slice of tasks.
- **oracle_at_f**: A cheater that escalates *exactly* the ones the small model got wrong (the absolute best possible performance).
- **armB**: Your real router (the actual `llm-gate` logic).

**What does "good" look like?** `armB` should land **above** the `random_at_f` line and **below** the `oracle_at_f` line on the graph.

## Setup — step by step

**Prerequisites:**
1. Ollama is running and your SLM model is pulled.
2. A paid API key is in your `.env` file under the `CLOUD_*` variables.
3. The `llm-gate` server must be running.

**Flow:**
Open two terminals.

In Terminal 1, start the gate:
```bash
pnpm run llm-gate:serve
```

In Terminal 2, run the benchmark (we'll start small with 10 tasks):
```bash
pnpm run bench -- --n 10
```

When it finishes, a successful run prints:
```text
Wrote output/deferral_curve.svg
Wrote output/leaderboard.md
```
You can view the results in the `output/` folder!

## How to read your results

Check your `output/deferral_curve.svg` and `output/leaderboard.md` for two things:

1. **`armB` is above the random line** = Your router is smart! It's escalating the right tasks. If `armB` is exactly *on* the random line, the router is no better than a coin flip and bought you nothing.
2. **`all_slm` is below `armA`** = There are hard tasks in your dataset that were worth escalating. If `all_slm` and `armA` have the exact same accuracy, your test tasks are too easy and the curve proves nothing. Add harder tasks to your dataset!

## The cache, explained

Calling the cloud API is slow and costs real money. To fix this, answers are saved and reused from a cache.

- **Where it lives**: `harness/.cache/`
- **Safe to delete**: You can delete this folder at any time; the harness will just re-fetch the answers.
- **Model-aware**: The cache is tied to the specific model and prompt version that produced each answer. If you change your model in `.env`, the harness will automatically re-fetch the answers rather than improperly reusing the old model's work.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Cost warning**
> Running the harness spends real money on the API cloud (roughly N tasks worth of big-model calls the first time you run it). 
> 
> The `--n` flag controls how many tasks to run. Start small (e.g., `--n 10`) before running the full suite!

## Langfuse Dashboard Configurations

### Evaluators
To measure quality (`task_pass`, `gates_satisfied`), configure these in the Langfuse UI:
1. Go to **Evaluators** -> **New Evaluator**.
2. Select **LLM-as-a-Judge** or **Deterministic** (depending on your setup).
3. For `task_pass`: Configure it to check if the final output contains a success indicator (or use an LLM prompt to grade).
4. For `gates_satisfied`: Configure it to verify that the required context was preserved by the gate.

### Monitors (Alerts)
To get alerts for regressions, configure these in the Langfuse UI under **Monitors**:
1. **Task Pass Drop Alert**: Trigger when `score_name="task_pass"` drops below `0.8`.
2. **Cost Spike Alert**: Trigger when `cost` per turn is unexpectedly high (e.g., `> 0.05`).

## Troubleshooting

- **"Only all_slm computed"**: You have no `CLOUD_*` key or model set in `.env`.
- **"Connection refused"**: The `llm-gate` server isn't running in another terminal.
- **"armB on the random line"**: Your router needs tuning. Adjust your `HEADLINE_STRICTNESS` in `.env`.
- **"Curve is flat / all_slm ≈ armA"**: Your dataset tasks are too easy.

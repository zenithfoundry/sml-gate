## 1. What is slm-gate?

`small-language-model-gate` (CLI shortname: **`slm-gate`**) is a **local AI pre-processing and routing layer** that sits in front of your AI coding assistant and quietly does two very useful things before anything reaches the paid cloud:

**It compresses the noise.** Your editor constantly packages up huge files, long logs, and sprawling system instructions and sends them to the cloud AI with every single message. Most of that is content the AI skims past. `slm-gate` intercepts this, runs a small, fast, free AI on your own computer, and strips it down to what actually matters — sending a fraction of the original text to the cloud.

**It answers easy questions locally.** Many routine requests — checking a value, summarising a short snippet, classifying intent — don't need a powerful cloud model. `slm-gate` handles those locally for free, so they never reach your paid plan at all.

The result: your paid AI plan lasts dramatically longer. Whether you're on a subscription (Claude Pro, Cursor Pro, Gemini Advanced, ChatGPT Plus) or paying per-token via an API key, you spend far less on the same amount of real work.

### Why You Need This

Every AI subscription comes with rate limits. Claude Pro's five-hour windows, Cursor's monthly turn caps, ChatGPT Plus's hourly message limits — these aren't just numbers. Hit them mid-project and you're waiting hours to continue. `slm-gate` acts as a buffer. By intercepting routine traffic and compressing what does go to the cloud, your effective quota stretches much further.

On pay-per-token API plans (like `gpt-4o` or Claude Sonnet via API key), every token costs money. Sending a 500-line file when the model only needed 30 lines of context is a direct waste of budget. `slm-gate` eliminates that waste automatically.

### Key Benefits

| Benefit | What It Means For You |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Quota Protection** | Fewer turns and tokens consumed means your subscription window lasts longer |
| **$0 Local Execution** | Small, repetitive queries answered free by your local machine |
| **Context Compression** | Large files, logs, and tool responses trimmed intelligently before hitting the cloud |
| **Privacy** | Less of your actual code and data leaves your machine |
| **Provider-Agnostic** | Works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

### What Gets Measured: Your Savings Dashboard

`slm-gate` records every decision it makes in a local database file on your computer (a SQLite database — think of it as a simple, fast spreadsheet that lives on your machine). For every request, it logs:

- How many tokens (units of text) were in the original payload
- How many tokens remained after compression
- Whether the request was answered locally (free) or forwarded to the cloud
- How long the local processing took
- The simulated dollar cost saved (for API key users)

**Checking your savings is one command:**

```bash
pnpm run slm-gate metrics
```

This prints a clean, offline summary showing tokens saved, compression ratio, requests handled locally, and how many extra minutes of subscription headroom you've gained — no API keys, no internet connection required.

**Want a visual dashboard?** If you set up [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) (a free, open-source observability tool), `slm-gate` will also send traces there, giving you graphs, latency breakdowns, and session-by-session analysis. Langfuse is completely optional — the local metrics command always works regardless.

---

## 2. Prerequisites & Hardware Sizing

### Required Software

Before you start, you need three things installed on your computer:

**1. Node.js (version 20 or later)**

Node.js is the runtime that `slm-gate` itself runs on. Check if you have it:

```bash
node -v
# Should print: v20.x.x or higher
```

If not, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (choose the LTS version).

**2. pnpm (package manager)**

`pnpm` is the tool used to install `slm-gate`'s dependencies. Install it once:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

**3. Ollama (the local AI runner)**

Ollama is a free program that downloads and runs small AI models on your machine — no cloud account needed. Install it from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/download) and make sure it's running. You can verify with:

```bash
ollama list
# Should print a list of downloaded models (empty is fine initially)
```

Ollama should be reachable at `http://localhost:11434` (its default address).

### Optional Prerequisites

These are not required to get started, but unlock additional capabilities:

- **[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/)** — A free, open-source web dashboard for visualising your AI usage and token savings. Self-hostable or use the cloud version. You only need this if you want richer visual analytics beyond the CLI metrics command.
- **Cloud API Key** — An `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or similar. Only needed if you plan to use Layer 2 (`llm-gate` for model endpoint routing) or run the offline benchmarking harness. For Layer 1 subscription users, no API key is needed.
- **[Tech-Lead-Stack](https://github.com/bronz3beard/ai.tech-lead-stack)** — An optional companion MCP server that `slm-gate` can sit in front of. See [Section 3](#3-how-it-operates-choosing-your-integration-layer) for details.

### Machine Sizing & Hardware Recommendations

<a id="appendix-c-ram-by-machine-model-table"></a>

Choosing the right local AI model for your machine is the single most important setup decision. Too large a model and your computer will slow to a crawl; too small and the compression quality suffers.

#### ⚡ Built-In Preflight Diagnostic Tools

Before downloading any models, let `slm-gate`'s built-in tools tell you exactly what your machine can handle:

```bash
# 1. Inspect your pulled models and get two personalised preset recommendations:
npm run models:check
# or: node dist/cli.js models:check

# 2. Run a full hardware + connectivity check:
pnpm run dev doctor
# or: node dist/cli.js doctor
```

- **`models:check`** reads your installed Ollama models, calculates their total memory footprint, and recommends two configurations tailored to your machine:
  - **Option A (Dedicated AI Node):** Maximises model quality when `slm-gate` is the main workload on this machine.
  - **Option B (Primary Workhorse):** Leaves enough memory free for your OS, browser, and IDE to avoid slowdowns and disk swapping.
- **`doctor`** detects your CPU architecture (Apple Silicon, Intel, CUDA), measures your available RAM, verifies Ollama is reachable, checks whether your context window setting (`NUM_CTX`) fits your hardware, and automatically writes a safe fallback configuration if it detects potential memory issues.

> [!TIP]
> **Not sure which models run well on your exact machine? Use `llmfit`.**
>
> [AlexsJones/llmfit](https://github.com/AlexsJones/llmfit) is an open-source terminal tool (with both a CLI and an interactive terminal UI) that right-sizes local AI models to your specific machine — measuring your RAM, CPU, GPU/VRAM, and estimating real tokens-per-second performance. It scores models across quality, speed, fit, and context dimensions, and supports Ollama, llama.cpp, MLX, and Docker Model Runner.
>
> ```bash
> # macOS / Linux (Homebrew)
> brew install AlexsJones/llmfit/llmfit
>
> # Windows (Scoop)
> scoop install llmfit
> ```

#### RAM-by-Machine Model Table

Use the table below to pick your starting models. The **RAM Preset** column maps directly to the preset `.env` files in the `configs/` folder — you can copy the matching preset instead of configuring from scratch.

| RAM | RAM Preset | Brain Model (Smarter, Heavier Tasks) | Gate Model (Fast Router, Quick Decisions) |
| :--------- | :---------- | :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **16 GB** | `ram-16` | `qwen2.5-coder:3b`, `tinyllama` | `qwen2.5-coder:0.5b` |
| **24 GB** | `ram-24` | `qwen3.5:4b`, `llama3.2:3b` | `qwen2.5-coder:3b`, `phi3:mini` |
| **32 GB** | `ram-32` | `qwen2.5:7b`, `mistral:7b` | `qwen2.5-coder:3b`, `phi3:mini` |
| **64 GB** | `ram-64` | `qwen3.5:9b`, `llama3:8b` | `qwen3.5:4b`, `llama3.2:3b` |
| **128 GB** | `ram-128` | `qwen3:14b`, `llama3:70b (Q4)` | `qwen3:7b`, `mistral:7b` |

> **What is the "Brain" vs. "Gate" model?** `slm-gate` uses two local models:
> - The **Gate model** is tiny and fast. Its only job is to make split-second routing decisions: "Can I handle this locally, or does it need to go to the cloud?" Speed is everything here.
> - The **Brain model** is slightly larger and smarter. It does the actual compression, summarisation, and local resolution when the Gate decides a request can be handled on-device.

#### Dual-Model Setup: Keeping Both Models Ready at Once

When running both a Gate model and a Brain model, you want both loaded in memory at the same time — otherwise Ollama has to swap one out every time it switches, adding several seconds of latency to each request.

```bash
# macOS (set permanently via launchctl)
launchctl setenv OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS 2

# Linux / any terminal session
export OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=2
```

> **Note on Memory Limits:** Loading two models simultaneously means Ollama must allocate memory for both their caches at once. On Apple Silicon Macs, this is strictly capped by the amount of unified memory (RAM) you have.
> - **24 GB Mac:** Set `NUM_CTX=8192` to safely fit both models.
> - **16 GB Mac:** Set `NUM_CTX=4096` to safely fit both models.
>
> If one model keeps getting unloaded to make room for the other, lower your `NUM_CTX` value.

#### 🍏 macOS + Homebrew Users: Avoid This Common Pitfall

If you installed Ollama via Homebrew (`brew install ollama`), there is a well-known configuration trap you must avoid.

> [!WARNING]
> **The Homebrew Configuration Trap:** Running `brew services restart ollama` **silently overwrites** the Ollama launch configuration file at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.ollama.plist`. Any custom environment variables you have added — such as `OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS` or `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` — will be deleted without warning. This causes models to be aggressively swapped in and out of memory, resulting in very slow responses and context being truncated.

**The Permanent Fix:**

1. Stop the Homebrew-managed Ollama service:
   ```bash
   brew services stop ollama
   ```
2. Open `~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.ollama.plist` in a text editor and manually add your required environment variables:
   ```xml
   <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
   <dict>
     <key>OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH</key><string>8192</string>
     <key>OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE</key><string>12h</string>
     <key>OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS</key><string>2</string>
   </dict>
   ```
3. Load the configuration natively (bypassing Homebrew's restart mechanism):
   ```bash
   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.ollama.plist
   ```

*For more details, see the [official Ollama FAQ on memory and concurrency](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md).*

#### Memory Pressure Troubleshooting

If your computer feels sluggish after starting `slm-gate`, or models keep unloading unexpectedly, the culprit is almost always memory. Here is how to think about it:

```
Total Memory Used = Model Weights + (Context Window Size × KV Cache) × Number of Models Loaded
```

In plain terms: the bigger your models and the larger the context window (`NUM_CTX`), the more RAM gets used. The two biggest levers you have are:

1. **Drop `NUM_CTX` first.** Halving the context window (e.g., from `8192` to `4096`) saves a very significant amount of memory — often more than switching to a smaller model. Do this first.
2. **Switch to a smaller Brain model.** If memory is still tight after reducing `NUM_CTX`, drop down one row in the RAM table above (e.g., from 9B to 7B to 3B).
3. **Force single-model mode as a last resort.** Setting `OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1` forces Ollama to only keep one model in memory at a time. Switching between Gate and Brain will be slower, but the total memory usage drops significantly.

**Step-by-step troubleshooting checklist:**

```bash
# 1. See what models you currently have downloaded
ollama list

# 2. Run the built-in memory fitness check
pnpm run dev doctor
```

Then in your `.env` (or your editor's MCP config block), adjust:
```bash
SLM_BRAIN_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b      # Try a smaller brain model
SLM_GATE_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:0.5b  # Keep the gate model tiny
NUM_CTX=4096                     # This is the biggest single win
OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=2       # Or set to 1 if still tight
```

*You must pull any new model before using it: `ollama pull <model-name>`*

## 3. How It Operates: Choosing Your Integration Layer

`slm-gate` has two independent operating modes — think of them as two different places where the gate can be inserted into your workflow. You can use one, the other, or both at the same time.

### Layer 1: `mcp-gate` — The Tool & Skill Payload Compressor

**Best for:** Subscription users (Claude Pro, Cursor Pro, Gemini Advanced, ChatGPT Plus, etc.) who want to protect their turn and message quotas.

**How it works:** Your AI editor communicates with external tools using a standard called the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. When a tool returns a response — say, the contents of a large file or the output of a long-running command — that response goes into your editor's context window and costs you tokens. `mcp-gate` acts as a proxy that intercepts those tool responses *before* they reach your editor, compresses them using your local AI, and sends only the essential content onward.

You **do not need an API key** to use Layer 1. Your subscription-based editor handles the actual AI reasoning; `slm-gate` just keeps the context it receives clean and compact.

**The primary example — Tech-Lead-Stack:**

[Tech-Lead-Stack](https://github.com/bronz3beard/ai.tech-lead-stack) is a companion MCP server that turns your AI assistant into a full software-delivery team, working through structured phases from planning to code review. Its skill payloads can be large. With `slm-gate` in front of it, each skill payload is compressed before it hits your editor — dramatically reducing quota consumption per turn.

```
Your Editor (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
    │
    ▼
slm-gate (mcp-gate)      ← Intercepts & compresses tool payloads
    │
    ▼
Tech-Lead-Stack MCP      ← (or any other MCP server)
    │
    ▼
Your tools & files
```

To use Tech-Lead-Stack as your downstream:
1. Install and build Tech-Lead-Stack (`pnpm run mcp:build` in the TLS directory).
2. In your `slm-gate` config, set `DOWNSTREAM_MCP` to point at the TLS build path and set `TLS_ADAPTER=on`.

**Works with any MCP server.** Tech-Lead-Stack is the recommended companion, but `mcp-gate` is fully downstream-agnostic. Any MCP server — or a combination — can sit behind it. Popular options include:

| MCP Server | What It Does |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Tech-Lead-Stack](https://github.com/bronz3beard/ai.tech-lead-stack) | Full software delivery team (planning, review, security, release) |
| [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) | Official reference servers: Filesystem, Git, Memory, Fetch, PostgreSQL |
| [Firecrawl](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl) | Web scraping and crawling with structured output |
| [Browser MCP](https://github.com/browsermcp/mcp) | Browser automation and web interaction |
| [Linear](https://github.com/tacticlaunch/mcp-linear) | Project management and issue tracking |
| [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/github) | Repository management and GitHub API |
| [Sourcerer](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/sourcerer-mcp) | Semantic code search that reduces token waste |

> **No downstream MCP server?** That's fine too. Without a `DOWNSTREAM_MCP` configured, `mcp-gate` runs as a standalone MCP server exposing a single `condition_prompt` tool — you add it to your editor and it will compress any prompt you send through it.

---

### Layer 2: `llm-gate` — The Model Endpoint Proxy

**Best for:** Users with cloud API keys (pay-per-token), or editors that let you override the AI model base URL (Cursor, Cline, Continue, Claude Code).

**How it works:** Some editors let you point their AI at a custom endpoint URL instead of the standard cloud provider. `llm-gate` is an HTTP server that listens on `http://localhost:8787` and pretends to be that cloud provider (it speaks both OpenAI and Anthropic API formats). Your editor thinks it's talking to Claude or GPT — but it's actually talking to `llm-gate` first. `llm-gate` answers simple requests locally for free, and only forwards genuinely complex tasks to your real cloud API.

```
Your Editor
    │
    ▼
slm-gate (llm-gate)       ← Local proxy on http://localhost:8787
    │ answers locally      → returns response for easy tasks
    │ forwards to cloud    → complex tasks go to your cloud API
    ▼
Your Cloud AI (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
```

---

### The Two Cloud Models: Understanding What You're Paying For

This distinction is important and affects which settings you need in your config:

**1. Subscription Model (Flat Monthly Fee)**

This is the AI built into your editor — the one you pay a fixed monthly fee for. Examples:
- Claude Pro / Max / Team in **Claude Code** or **Claude Desktop**
- Gemini Advanced / Antigravity in **Google Antigravity**
- Cursor Pro in **Cursor**
- Copilot in **GitHub Copilot**
- ChatGPT Plus / Pro in **Cline** or **Continue**

When using Layer 1 (`mcp-gate`) with a subscription model, `slm-gate` compresses what goes into the editor's context. You don't need a `CLOUD_API_KEY` for this — the subscription handles the AI side. The `CLOUD_*` environment variables are **not needed for Layer 1 subscription users**.

**2. Metered API Model (Pay-Per-Token)**

This is an endpoint you access directly with an API key — billed per-token, to the cent. Examples: `gpt-4o` via `OPENAI_API_KEY`, Claude Sonnet via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

Layer 2 (`llm-gate`) uses this as its cloud fallback. When a request is too complex for the local model, it forwards to this endpoint. The cost of each forwarded request is logged in the ledger.

---

### Client Compatibility Matrix

| Client | Layer 1 (`mcp-gate`) | Layer 2 (`llm-gate`) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Google Antigravity / Antigravity 2 / `agy` CLI** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Claude Code** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Claude Desktop** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Cursor** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Cline (VS Code)** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Continue (VS Code)** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **ChatGPT / OpenAI-compatible clients** | ✅ | ✅ |

> **Why does Antigravity not support Layer 2?** Antigravity uses an internal Gemini routing pipeline with no user-configurable base URL override — there's no setting to redirect its chat completions to a local proxy. Layer 1 (MCP-based compression) works perfectly.
> **Why does Claude Desktop not support Layer 2?** Claude Desktop is strictly wired to Anthropic's hosted infrastructure. There is no setting or environment variable to redirect its chat stream to a local endpoint.

---

## 4. Step-by-Step Setup Walkthrough

Follow these steps in order. By the end, `slm-gate` will be running and wired up to your editor. Then head to [Section 5](#5-configuration-setup-guide) to fine-tune your settings.

---

### Step 1 — Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bronz3beard/small-language-model-gate.git
cd small-language-model-gate
```

This downloads `slm-gate` into a folder called `small-language-model-gate` in your current directory.

---

### Step 2 — Install Dependencies & Build

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

`pnpm install` downloads all the code libraries `slm-gate` needs. `pnpm run build` compiles the TypeScript source into runnable JavaScript files in the `dist/` folder. You should see no errors.

> _If you later modify any `.ts` source files, run `pnpm run build` again to pick up changes._

---

### Step 3 — Start Ollama & Download Local Models

Make sure Ollama is running. On macOS, it runs as a background app — look for the llama icon in your menu bar, or start it:

```bash
# Start Ollama (if not already running)
ollama serve
```

Then download the models for your machine. For a **16 GB machine** (the recommended starting point):

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:3b    # Brain model: smarter, used for compression & local resolution
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:0.5b  # Gate model: tiny, used for quick routing decisions
```

Check the [RAM table in Section 2](#ram-by-machine-model-table) to find the right models for your machine's memory.

> _Not sure what to pick? Run `npm run models:check` after pulling a model and it will recommend the best pair for your hardware._

---

### Step 4 — Wire Up Your Editor / Client

Find your editor below and follow those steps. Each client config uses an **absolute path** to the built `slm-gate` file — replace `<ABS_PATH>` with the full path to where you cloned the repo.

To find your absolute path, run this in your terminal from inside the `small-language-model-gate` folder:

```bash
pwd
# Example output: /Users/yourname/projects/small-language-model-gate
```

Your built MCP entry point will be at: `/Users/yourname/projects/small-language-model-gate/dist/mcp-gate/index.js`

---

#### Google Antigravity (Antigravity IDE, Antigravity 2, `agy` CLI)

Antigravity reads its MCP server list from a global configuration file. You add `slm-gate` there.

**File to edit:** `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`

If the file doesn't exist yet, create it. Add (or merge) the following into the `mcpServers` block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slm-gate": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/yourname/projects/small-language-model-gate/dist/mcp-gate/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SLM_BRAIN_MODEL": "qwen2.5-coder:3b",
        "SLM_GATE_MODEL": "qwen2.5-coder:0.5b",
        "NUM_CTX": "4096",
        "OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS": "2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Important:** For Antigravity, your configuration lives **directly in this JSON block**, not in a `.env` file. The `.env.*.example` preset files in `configs/antigravity/` are reference documents — values you want active must be added to the `"env"` block above.

**Using Tech-Lead-Stack as your downstream?** Add these two extra keys to the `env` block:
```json
"TLS_ADAPTER": "on",
"DOWNSTREAM_MCP": "{\"command\":\"node\",\"args\":[\"/abs/path/to/tech-lead-stack/dist/mcp-server.mjs\"]}"
```

After saving, reload MCP servers in Antigravity (usually via the Settings → MCP panel or a restart).

See the full config reference: [`configs/antigravity/README.md`](configs/antigravity/README.md)

---

#### Claude (Claude Code & Claude Desktop)

**Claude Code** (the `claude` terminal app):

The easiest way to add `slm-gate` to Claude Code is the CLI one-liner:

```bash
claude mcp add-json slm-gate '{
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/Users/yourname/projects/small-language-model-gate/dist/mcp-gate/index.js"],
  "env": {
    "SLM_BRAIN_MODEL": "qwen2.5-coder:3b",
    "SLM_GATE_MODEL": "qwen2.5-coder:0.5b",
    "NUM_CTX": "4096"
  }
}'
```

Alternatively, create or edit `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slm-gate": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/yourname/projects/small-language-model-gate/dist/mcp-gate/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SLM_BRAIN_MODEL": "qwen2.5-coder:3b",
        "SLM_GATE_MODEL": "qwen2.5-coder:0.5b",
        "NUM_CTX": "4096"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Layer 2 (optional — model endpoint override):** To route all model calls through `llm-gate`:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8787"
```

> _Note: Setting this causes Claude Code to inline tool schemas instead of using server-side Tool Search. Everything still works; the behaviour is slightly different._

See the full config reference: [`configs/claude-code/README.md`](configs/claude-code/README.md)

---

**Claude Desktop** (the Anthropic desktop app):

**File to edit:**
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slm-gate": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/yourname/projects/small-language-model-gate/dist/mcp-gate/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SLM_BRAIN_MODEL": "qwen2.5-coder:3b",
        "SLM_GATE_MODEL": "qwen2.5-coder:0.5b",
        "NUM_CTX": "4096"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving.

See the full config reference: [`configs/claude-desktop/README.md`](configs/claude-desktop/README.md)

---

#### Cursor

Create or edit the file `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project workspace root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slm-gate": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/yourname/projects/small-language-model-gate/dist/mcp-gate/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SLM_BRAIN_MODEL": "qwen2.5-coder:3b",
        "SLM_GATE_MODEL": "qwen2.5-coder:0.5b",

#### VS Code Extensions: Cline & Continue

Both Cline and Continue are AI coding extensions for VS Code and JetBrains that support custom MCP servers and full provider flexibility.

**Cline** — edit `cline_mcp.json` (usually at `~/.cline/cline_mcp.json` or in your project root):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slm-gate": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/yourname/projects/small-language-model-gate/dist/mcp-gate/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SLM_BRAIN_MODEL": "qwen2.5-coder:3b",
        "SLM_GATE_MODEL": "qwen2.5-coder:0.5b",
        "NUM_CTX": "4096"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Continue** — edit `.continue/config.yaml` in your project root or home directory:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: slm-gate
    command: node
    args:
      - /Users/yourname/projects/small-language-model-gate/dist/mcp-gate/index.js
    env:
      SLM_BRAIN_MODEL: "qwen2.5-coder:3b"
      SLM_GATE_MODEL: "qwen2.5-coder:0.5b"
      NUM_CTX: "4096"
```

**Layer 2 (optional — model endpoint override):** In Cline or Continue settings, select **OpenAI-Compatible** as the provider and enter `http://localhost:8787/v1` as the base URL (often labelled `apiBase`).

See the full config reference: [`configs/cline-continue-opencode/README.md`](configs/cline-continue-opencode/README.md)

#### ChatGPT & OpenAI-Compatible Clients

Any client that supports a custom OpenAI-compatible base URL can use `llm-gate` (Layer 2):

1. Start the LLM gate layer: `pnpm run dev --layer llm` (or `node dist/cli.js serve --layer llm`)
2. In your client settings, set the base URL to `http://localhost:8787/v1`
3. Use any model name — `llm-gate` will route locally or forward to your configured `CLOUD_MODEL`

For MCP (Layer 1) support, check your specific client's MCP documentation and add the same JSON MCP server config shown in the other examples above.

### ✅ You're Set Up! What's Next?

With your editor wired up, proceed to **[Section 5: Configuration Setup Guide](#5-configuration-setup-guide)** to create your `.env` file with the right settings for your machine — starting from the 16 GB preset.

---

## 5. Configuration Setup Guide

`slm-gate` is configured through a `.env` file — a plain text file in the root of the repository that holds your settings. Think of it as a control panel with clearly labelled switches.

### Quick Start: Copy Your RAM Preset

Instead of starting from scratch, find your machine's RAM in the table below and copy the matching preset file for your editor. These are fully commented templates with sensible defaults already filled in.

> **Using 16 GB RAM?** That's the baseline configuration used throughout this guide. Copy the preset for your editor and you're most of the way there.

#### All Configuration Preset Files

> **Note for Antigravity users:** Your active configuration lives in the `"env"` block of `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`, not in a `.env` file. The preset files above are reference templates — copy the values you need from them into your `mcp_config.json` env block.

### The 16 GB Baseline Configuration

### Configuration Setting Reference

Every setting `slm-gate` reads is explained below in plain English. Settings are grouped in the order they matter most during setup.

#### Local Model (SLM) Settings

- **`SLM_PROVIDER`** — Where your local AI comes from. `ollama` runs it on your machine for free (the normal choice). `openai` redirects it to a cheap hosted model instead — useful if your machine can't run a local AI.
- **`OLLAMA_HOST`** — The address where Ollama is listening. Only change this if you're running Ollama on a different machine or port. Default: `http://localhost:11434`
- **`OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE`** — How long a loaded model stays in memory after use. Keeping it loaded means instant responses next time; lowering it frees memory. Default: `12h`
- **`SLM_BRAIN_MODEL`** — The name of your smarter local model, used for compression, summarisation, and local resolution of harder tasks.
- **`SLM_GATE_MODEL`** — The name of your tiny, fast local model, used only for routing decisions ("can I handle this locally?"). Speed is the priority here.
- **`SLM_GATE_TESTING_MODEL`** — Only used when running the benchmarking harness. Ignore for everyday use.
- **`NUM_CTX`** — The maximum amount of text the local model can consider in a single request, measured in tokens (roughly ¾ of a word per token). Larger values allow the model to consider more context at once, but use significantly more memory. Default: `8192` — reduce to `4096` for 16 GB machines.
- **`TEMPERATURE`** — How creative or random the local model's responses are. `0` means fully deterministic (always the same answer for the same input). Keep this at `0` — this tool needs consistent, repeatable decisions. Default: `0`
- **`SLM_TIMEOUT_MS`** — How long to wait for the local model to respond before giving up and escalating to the cloud. Increase if you have a slow machine. Default: `120000` (2 minutes)
- **`SELF_CONSISTENCY_K`** — When double-checking a local answer, how many times to silently re-ask the question. If all answers agree, the result is trusted. If they disagree, the request escalates to the cloud. Default: `3`
- **`SELF_CONSISTENCY_TEMP`** — The randomness used during those re-checks. A small amount of randomness is intentional — if the model gives the same answer even when nudged to vary, that's a strong signal it's correct. Default: `0.7`

#### Verifier Strictness

After the local AI answers, a "verifier" grades whether the answer is good enough to trust. These control how strict that grading is.

- **`STRICTNESS_LEVELS`** — The available grading levels, from `0` (very lenient) to `5` (extremely strict). Leave this as-is. Default: `0,1,2,3,4,5`
- **`HEADLINE_STRICTNESS`** — The grading level actually in use. Higher means more local answers get escalated to the cloud (safer, higher quality, but costs more quota). Lower means more trust in local answers (saves more, but higher risk of lower quality). Default: `4`

#### Cloud Fallback & Semantic Cache

- **`CLOUD_API_STYLE`** — Which API format your cloud provider uses: `openai` or `anthropic`.
- **`CLOUD_BASE_URL`** — The address of your cloud AI provider's API.
- **`CLOUD_API_KEY`** — Your API key for the cloud provider. **Leave blank** if you are using Layer 1 with a subscription-based editor.
- **`CLOUD_MODEL`** — The exact model name to use for cloud fallback.
- **`SEMCACHE`** — Turns on "answer reuse." When enabled, identical read-only questions are answered from memory instead of making a new cloud call. Off by default. (`on` / `off`)
- **`SEMCACHE_THRESHOLD`** — How similar two questions must be before the old answer is reused. `0.95` is very strict. Default: `0.95`
- **`EMBED_MODEL`** — The local model used to measure question similarity. Default: `nomic-embed-text`

#### Server Ports & Downstream MCP

- **`LLM_GATE_PORT`** — The port `llm-gate` listens on. Only change if something else is using this port. Default: `8787`
- **`LLM_GATE_EXPOSE`** — Which API formats `llm-gate` accepts. Default: `openai,anthropic`
- **`DOWNSTREAM_MCP`** — If you want `mcp-gate` to sit in front of another MCP server (like Tech-Lead-Stack), put that server's launch command here as a JSON string. Leave blank for standalone mode.
- **`MCP_GATE_TRANSPORT`** — How `mcp-gate` communicates with your editor: `stdio` (your editor launches it directly) or `http` (network connection). Most setups use `stdio`. Default: `stdio`
- **`MCP_GATE_PORT`** — The port for HTTP mode only. Default: `8788`

#### Ledger & Telemetry

- **`LEDGER_PATH`** — Where the local database file is stored. This is what `pnpm run slm-gate metrics` reads from. Default: `./output/ledger.db`
- **`LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`**, **`LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`**, **`LANGFUSE_HOST`** — Optional Langfuse connection. Fill these in only if you're using Langfuse for visual dashboards. Leave blank otherwise.
- **`SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN`** — Tells the metrics dashboard which plan you're on, so it can calculate how much subscription runway you've reclaimed. Valid values: `claude-pro`, `claude-max-5x`, `claude-max-20x`, `chatgpt-go`, `chatgpt-plus`, `chatgpt-pro-5x`, `chatgpt-pro-20x`, `gemini-plus`, `gemini-pro`, `gemini-ultra`.

#### Context Trimming & Safe Recovery

When a tool response is very large, `slm-gate` compresses it and keeps only the essential parts. The original is stashed locally so the AI can retrieve any trimmed content cheaply on demand.

- **`DISTILL_MIN_TOKENS`** — Responses smaller than this (in tokens) are passed through untouched — they're too small to be worth compressing. **500 tokens ≈ ~50 lines of code.** Default: `500`
- **`DISTILL_MAX_TOKENS`** — The maximum size a response can be after compression. Anything still over this limit after compression gets trimmed, and a retrieval marker is inserted so the AI can ask for the trimmed content. **2000 tokens ≈ ~200 lines of code.** Default: `2000`
- **`DISTILL_PRESERVE_PATH`** — Path to a file listing text patterns that must never be compressed or altered (e.g., specific code markers). Optional.
- **`DISTILL_PRESERVE_MODE`** — Whether your custom patterns are added to (`extend`) or replace (`replace`) the built-in protection list. Use `extend`. Default: `extend`
- **`KEEP_RECENT_TOOL_TURNS`** — How many of the most recent tool responses to always keep in full (never compress), because they're almost certainly still needed. Default: `2`
- **`ELISION_MAX_ENTRIES`** — Maximum number of original (pre-compression) responses stored in the local recovery cache. Default: `5000`
- **`ELISION_RETENTION_DAYS`** — How long a stored original is kept before automatic cleanup. Default: `180` days
- **`ELISION_MAX_MB`** — Total disk space budget for the recovery cache. When exceeded, the oldest entries are deleted first. Default: `500 MB`

#### Advanced: Routing Tuner & Misc

- **`ROUTING_TUNE`** — When `on`, the gate learns from past results which types of requests the local model handles well, and routes those directly to cloud for request types where it usually fails. (`on` / `off`)
- **`ROUTING_TUNE_WINDOW`** — How many recent requests (per type) to consider. Default: `20`
- **`ROUTING_TUNE_MIN_SAMPLES`** — Minimum sample count before the tuner acts on a category's success rate. Default: `8`
- **`ROUTING_TUNE_THRESHOLD`** — Success rate below which the gate stops trying local for that request type. Default: `0.5`
- **`ROUTING_TUNE_EXPLORE_RATE`** — How often to try local even for categories it's learned to skip — keeps it adapting to improvement. Default: `0.15`
- **`RESOLVER_CLOUD_TIER`** — When `on`, allows the local AI to make a small, budgeted cloud call when it hits a genuinely ambiguous decision. (`on` / `off`)
- **`RESOLVER_CLOUD_BUDGET_USD`** — Hard dollar cap on the above feature. Default: `0` (off until you set a budget)
- **`RAM_PRESET`** — A convenience toggle that auto-selects sensible model defaults based on your RAM: `ram-8`, `ram-16`, `ram-32`, or `custom`.
- **`TLS_ADAPTER`** — Enables special handling for Tech-Lead-Stack payloads. Set to `on` only if TLS is your downstream. (`on` / `off`)

## 6. Verification & Day-to-Day Use

### Run the Preflight Health Check

Before using `slm-gate` in anger, confirm everything is wired up correctly:

```bash
pnpm run dev doctor
# or: node dist/cli.js doctor
```

This checks:
- Node.js version
- Ollama is reachable and responding
- Your configured models are downloaded and their sizes fit in your available RAM
- `NUM_CTX` fits within your memory budget
- Layer 1 / Layer 2 config is valid

Fix any warnings it flags before proceeding.

### Check Your Savings (Any Time)

```bash
pnpm run slm-gate metrics
```

Prints a live summary from your local ledger: tokens saved, compression ratio, local vs. cloud routing split, and subscription runway reclaimed. No internet required.

### Verify Active Compression in Your Editor

When your editor calls a tool (like `get_skill` in Tech-Lead-Stack), the response that arrives in your editor's context should be noticeably shorter than the raw output — but still contain all the critical content (headings marked `MUST`, YAML frontmatter, phase markers).

To see `slm-gate` working in real-time, check your editor's MCP logs for the string `[pipeline] distill`:

| Editor | How to View MCP Logs |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Antigravity** | Antigravity output/MCP tab |
| **Cursor** | Output panel → select "MCP" from dropdown |
| **Claude Desktop (macOS)** | `tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log` |
| **Claude Desktop (Windows)** | `type "%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp*.log"` |
| **Cline / VS Code** | VS Code Output panel → select "Cline" or your MCP server |
| **Claude Code** | Start with `--mcp-debug` flag for detailed terminal output |

### Cloud API Keys for Layer 1 Subscription Users

When using `mcp-gate` (Layer 1) with your editor's built-in subscription model, you **do not need** a `CLOUD_API_KEY`. The `CLOUD_*` variables are only required if:
- You use Layer 2 (`llm-gate`) with a cloud fallback endpoint, or
- You run the offline testing harness (`slm-gate bench`)

---

## 7. Architecture & Advanced Features

### Deep Dives

- **[Context Distillation and Elision](./docs/architecture/context-distillation-and-elision.md):** How `slm-gate` safely drops old tool outputs to save tokens, and how the elision cache allows cheap recovery of trimmed content.

### No-Ollama / Hosted Small-Model Fallback

If your machine cannot run Ollama (for example, it doesn't meet the minimum RAM requirements), you can point the local model layer at a cheap, hosted small model instead:

```bash
SLM_PROVIDER=openai
OLLAMA_HOST=https://api.openai.com/v1  # or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
SLM_BRAIN_MODEL=gpt-4.1-nano
SLM_GATE_MODEL=gpt-4.1-nano
```

> _Note: Because hosted "small" models still cost money and add network latency, the savings are lower than running locally. Token compression will still save cloud tokens, but local deferral savings will be minimal._

### Architectural Warning for Contributors

This project strictly uses **Native Structured Outputs** (`format: jsonSchema` / `response_format: { type: "json_schema" }`) for all deterministic logic. Do **not** use prompt engineering to request JSON in markdown blocks, and do not use regex extraction. On Apple Silicon (llama.cpp), models that don't emit proper stop tokens will ramble indefinitely and cause timeout failures.
